# 10-Card Memory Game

## Goal

This project is a classic memory game where the user is tasked with matching pairs of cards. The game consists of 10 cards (5 pairs) placed face down. The player flips two cards at a time and tries to match the cards. If the cards match, they stay face up; otherwise, they flip back over. The game is complete when all pairs have been matched and all cards are face up.
